## Project Proposal

There are many websites that can convert convert ICD-9 code into ICD-10 code (and vice versa), but they can only convert one code at a time, which consumed me a lot of time when I did my BST210 regression project. Thus, I want to use R to convert a set of ICD codes (as many as you want) all at once. 

For the 2nd part of this project, I will use data from Kaggle to build a regression model to predict opioids overdose. Because back in Taiwan, I was an anesthesiologist. In our daily practice, to treat patients' pain, opioids (such as morphine) are often used. However, opioids are very easily to be addictive to. Once these drugs are used overdose (very likely for those drug abusers), they would not only put people into sleep but suppress their breath, heart rate, and blood pressure -- but people cannot react because they are deeply sedated! In the end, they are usually found dead. To prevent these tragedies, if we can predict people potentially with higher possibility of opioids overdose, we may avoid using (or use less) these highly addictive drugs on them and adopt other alternative treatment or medications. 


##Part 1 Data Wrangling
##Introduction

My ICD codes files are from [here]( https://www.nber.org/research/data/icd-9-cm-and-icd-10-cm-and-icd-10-pcs-crosswalk-or-general-equivalence-mappings). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
icd_cm = read.csv("c:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\icd9toicd10cmgem.csv")
nrow(icd_cm)
head(icd_cm)
```


There are 23912 codes in this file, whereas the ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes are not in the correct form. Take the first row for example, there is no ICD-9 code = 10, instead, it should be 001.0, while the corresponding ICD-10 code = A00.0, rather than A000.

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"icd.png"))
```


Because of this error, there are identical ICD-9 codes in the file that actually should be different and correspond to different ICD-10 codes. Take ICD-9 = 320 in this file for example:

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"icd 320a.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"icd 320b.png"))
```


These 320s should be 003.20 and 032.0, while the corresponding ICD-10 codes are A02.20 (not A0220) and A36.0 (not A360):

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"icd 320 1.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(file.path(img_path,"icd 320 2.png"))
```


Now you may find out that 
(1) in the correct ICD-codes, there should be 3 numbers or 1 alphabet with 2 numbers before the decimal;
(2) for ICD-9 codes, we may need to add 1 zero or 2 zeros to some of the original codes in our file. 

Thus, after checking with the correct codes, I found out that in our file:
(1) for the first 1-81 ICD-9 codes, we need to add "00" before the original number, and then add "." after the 3rd number;
(2) for the first 82-1211 ICD-9 codes, we need to add "0" before the original number, and then add "." after the 3rd number;
(3) for the rest 1212-23912 ICD-9 codes, we need to add "." after the 3rd number;
(4) for all the ICD-10 codes, we just need to add "." after the 3rd number.

So let's start data wrangling!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##data wrangling 

#the first 1-81 icd-9 codes need to add 00 before the original number, then add "." after the 3rd number
icd9 = function(a){
  aaa = str_replace(a, "d*","00") 
  aaaa = substring(aaa,c(1,4),c(3,nchar(aaa)))
  a9 = paste(aaaa, collapse=".")
}

library(magicfor)
magic_for(silent = TRUE)

for (i in c(1:81)) {
  d = icd9(icd_cm$icd9cm[i])
  put(d)
}
d = magic_result_as_dataframe()
head(d$d)
icd_cm$icd9cm_n = 0
icd_cm$icd9cm_n[1:81] = d$d

#the first 82-1211 icd-9 codes need to add 0 before the original number, then add "." after the 3rd number
icd9b = function(b){
  bb = str_replace(b, "d*","0") 
  bbb = substring(bb,c(1,4),c(3,nchar(bb)))
  b9 = paste(bbb, collapse=".")
}

for (i in c(82:1211)) {
  dd = icd9b(icd_cm$icd9cm[i])
  put(dd)
}
dd = magic_result_as_dataframe()
tail(dd$dd)
icd_cm$icd9cm_n[82:1211] = dd$dd

#the rest 1212-23912 icd-9 codes need to add "." after the 3rd number
icd9c = function(c){ 
  cc = substring(c,c(1,4),c(3,nchar(c)))
  c9 = paste(cc, collapse=".")
}

for (i in c(1212:23912)) {
  ddd = icd9c(icd_cm$icd9cm[i])
  put(ddd)
}
ddd = magic_result_as_dataframe()
head(ddd$ddd)
icd_cm$icd9cm_n[1212:23912] = ddd$ddd

#all the icd-10 codes need to add "." after the 3rd number
icd10 = function(c){ 
  cc = substring(c,c(1,4),c(3,nchar(c)))
  c9 = paste(cc, collapse=".")
}

for (i in c(1:23912)) {
  dddd = icd10(icd_cm$icd10cm[i])
  put(dddd)
}
dddd = magic_result_as_dataframe()
head(dddd$dddd)
icd_cm$icd10cm_n = dddd$dddd
head(icd_cm)
```


And never forget those not-matching ones.
We know that either in ICD-9 or ICD-10, there should be digits. If it's no digits, it might be "NA" or "No data" or something similar.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
pattern = "\\d" 
length(icd_cm$icd9cm_n[str_detect(icd_cm$icd9cm_n, pattern)==F])
length(icd_cm$icd10cm_n[str_detect(icd_cm$icd10cm_n, pattern)==F])
icd_cm$icd10cm_n[str_detect(icd_cm$icd10cm_n, pattern)==F]
```


So there is no NA in our corrected ICD-9 codes (GOOD!), but there are 425 "NoD.x" in the  corrected ICD-10 codes. Let's replace it with NA.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
icd_cm = icd_cm |> mutate(icd10cm_n = replace(icd10cm_n, icd10cm_n == "NoD.x", NA))
```


Now let's add the disease description into our new dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
icd_cm_9d = read.csv("c:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\icd9d.csv")
names(icd_cm_9d)
head(icd_cm_9d)
class(icd_cm_9d$CODE)
nrow(icd_cm_9d)

icd_cm_10d = read.csv("c:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\icd10d.csv")
head(icd_cm_10d)
identical(icd_cm_10d$SHORT.DESCRIPTION,icd_cm_10d$LONG.DESCRIPTION)
head(icd_cm_10d[icd_cm_10d$SHORT.DESCRIPTION != icd_cm_10d$LONG.DESCRIPTION,])  
nrow(icd_cm_10d)
```


There are two disease descriptions in the icd_cm_10d file, I will use the more detailed one (the long description). 
And in these two files, the codes also should be corrected just like above.
After correction, we can join the tables.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
icd_d = function(c){ 
  cc = substring(c,c(1,4),c(3,nchar(c)))
  c9 = paste(cc, collapse=".")
}

for (i in c(1:13521)) {
  d9 = icd_d(icd_cm_9d$CODE[i])
  put(d9)
}
d9 = magic_result_as_dataframe()
head(d9$d9)
icd_cm_9d$icd9cm_n = d9$d9
head(icd_cm_9d)


for (i in c(1:72836)) {
  d10 = icd_d(icd_cm_10d$CODE[i])
  put(d10)
}
d10 = magic_result_as_dataframe()
head(d10$d10)
icd_cm_10d$icd10cm_n = d10$d10
head(icd_cm_10d)


##joint icd_cm & icd_cm_9d & icd_cm_10d
names(icd_cm)
names(icd_cm_9d)
icd_cm1 = full_join(icd_cm,icd_cm_9d, by = "icd9cm_n")
head(icd_cm1)
colnames(icd_cm1)[12] = "ICD9 Description"

icd_cm_all = full_join(icd_cm1,icd_cm_10d, by = "icd10cm_n")
head(icd_cm_all)
names(icd_cm_all)
colnames(icd_cm_all)[15] = "ICD10 Description"
names(icd_cm_all)

icd_cm_k = icd_cm_all |> select("icd9cm", "icd10cm", "flags", "icd9cm_n", "icd10cm_n", "ICD9 Description", "ICD10 Description")
```


Lastly, we need to add some warning signs because sometimes ICD-9 codes cannot exactly match  with the ICD-10 codes. 
Notice those flags? When the flag = 0, it means we can find the exact ICD-10 codes; when the flag = 10000, it means we can only find the most similar meaning ICD-10 codes; when the flag = 11000, sadly there's no such ICD-10 codes.
This is our last step of data wrangling!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##add matching warning
icd_cm_k$matching = ifelse(icd_cm_k$flags == 10000, "Approxiately matching", 
                           ifelse(icd_cm_k$flags == 11000, "No matching", "Exactly matching"))
head(icd_cm_k)
icd_cm_final = icd_cm_k[-c(1:3)]
head(icd_cm_final)
```


## Results

Finally, we can start to search the matching ICD-10 codes!
For example, if I want to convert ICD-9 = "E93.00","003.1","032.0":

```{r}
icd_cm_final |>
  filter(icd9cm_n %in% c("E93.00","003.1","032.0")) |> 
  summarise(icd9 = icd9cm_n, icd10 = icd10cm_n, footnote = matching)
```


We can find the corresponding ICD-10 codes along with their matching extent in the summarize  (footnote). 
And we can directly copy the corresponding ICD-10 codes into our word files or slides by using codes below:

```{r}
exp1 = icd_cm_final |>
  filter(icd9cm_n %in% c("E93.00","003.1","032.0")) |> 
  summarise(icd9 = icd9cm_n, icd10 = icd10cm_n, footnote = matching) |>
  pull(icd10)

exp1 |> 
  paste(collapse = " ") |>
  str_replace_all(" ", ", ")    
```

By using the codes below, we can directly copy a number of ICD codes from word files and paste them into " " and search!! No need to spend time to further separate them with " "!

```{r}
exp2 = c("E93.00, 003.1, 032.0")  
e2 = unlist(str_split(exp2, ", "))

icd_cm_final |>
  filter(icd9cm_n %in% c(e2[1:length(e2)])) |> 
  summarise(icd9 = icd9cm_n, icd10 = icd10cm_n, footnote = matching) |>
  pull(icd10)     
```

This is what I want!



##Part 2 Regression model

As mentioned above, I want to build a regression model to predict the possibility of opioids overdose. 

Firstly, the mean of opioids overdose rate is 8. I defined opioids overdose rate >8 as more likely to have opioids overdose, and <=8 as less likely, which becomes overdose_p in the data.

Secondly, Using overdose_p as outcome, putting all the possible covariates into the model as our full model (logistic regression). 

Though the performance of the full model is good (AIC= 417.32, AUC = 0.99), because there are many covariates related to finance, such as thealthspend (total health spend) and totalrealhcspend (total real hospital and clinics spend), considering collinearity and simplicity/parsimony, stateid (state),  totalrealhcspend (total health spend), labor_participation_pct (labor or not), grad_hs_pct (education), and cpi (consumer price index) are kept in my final model (s_model).

The performance of this final model is nice, with AIC: 551.68 and AUC = 0.9755. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
op = read.csv("c:\\Users\\user\\Downloads\\Opioid.csv")
head(op)
summary(op$overdose_rate)
op$overdose_p = ifelse(op$overdose_rate >8, 1,0)
names(op)

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(leaps)
library(MASS)
library(pROC)
library(plotROC)

full_model = glm(overdose_p ~ stateid + mcare_millions + medicaid_spend_actual + medicaidspending + thealthspend + totalrealhcspend + mdhhincomereal + stategdpml + realstategdp + unemployment_pct + labor_participation_pct + insured_pct + grad_hs_pct + is_manufacturing_state + post_recession + cpi , data = op, family = "binomial")

summary(full_model)

roc_curve_f = roc(op$overdose_p ,predict(full_model, type = c("response")))
roc_curve_f$auc
ggplot(op, aes(m = predict(full_model, type = c("response")), d = overdose_p))+ geom_roc(n.cuts = 0, labels = F, col = "blue")+ style_roc(theme = theme_grey) + ggtitle("ROC curve (AUC=0.99) by full model")


s_model = glm(formula = overdose_p ~ stateid + totalrealhcspend + labor_participation_pct +
                grad_hs_pct + cpi, data = op)
summary(s_model)

roc_curve = roc(op$overdose_p ,predict(s_model, type = c("response")))
roc_curve$auc
ggplot(op, aes(m = predict(s_model, type = c("response")), d = overdose_p))+ geom_roc(n.cuts = 0, labels = F, col = "red")+ style_roc(theme = theme_grey) + ggtitle("ROC curve (AUC=0.98) by final model")
```


##Conclusion

In part 1, I did data wrangling to convert ICD-9 to ICD-10. In part 2, I built a logistic regression model to predict the possibility of opioids overdose. I think both parts are quite successful. If I have more time, I would like to apply machine learning skills in part 2.
